## Notes

changing structure of accounts in the src/state folder might break the tests because existing accounts on the network will have a different structure

## ROADMAP

* [ ] Create a bucket with erc-20 tokens based on the evaluation of the company
* [ ] Create a rewards bucket (account) for every user of the company
* [ ] Unsafe: Create a link that allows the user to withdraw from the bucket to his account, this link will be sent to the user via email, maybe do some verification using merkle trees?
